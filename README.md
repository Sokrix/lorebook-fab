## About the author
Hi, my name is Tristan. As you may have seen, I'm not good in English, but I can read it and understand it well.

**Not everybody can do it, especially in latin countries where we are not comfortable with English.**

The French community aims to translate the "Welcome to Rathe" lorebook to make it accessible to non-English speakers.
